#About
Roll20 Super User is a chrome extension that uses the command pattern design to integrate new commands for Roll20.

#Install
In chrome, settings -> extensions, check dev mode, load unpacked extension, select this directory. Filtering out console.log'ing from Roll20 is highly recommend for working on this. Note that this extension is designed to be run on the DM/GM's browser. Playing characters interact with the extension through the game's chat.

#TODO
- Warn users if the extension becomes broken because of a change in roll 20
- Customize command behavior from the options page
